## Deliverables

### 1. System Documentation

**Plain English Description**:
```
[Project Name] System Overview

Purpose:
[Clear description of what the system does]

Components:
[List of contracts/modules and their roles]

Assumptions:
[Explicit assumptions about the codebase, environment, users]

Interactions:
[How components interact with each other]

Critical Operations:
[Key operations and their purposes]
```

**Architectural Diagrams**:
- Contract inheritance graph
- Contract interaction graph
- State machine diagram (if applicable)

**Code Documentation Gaps**:
- List of undocumented functions
- Missing NatSpec/documentation
- Unclear assumptions

### 4. Prioritized Recommendations

**CRITICAL** (address immediately):
- Security vulnerabilities
- Proxy implementation issues
- Missing critical events
- Broken upgrade paths

**HIGH** (address before deployment):
- Documentation gaps
- Testing improvements
- Dependency updates
- Architecture optimizations

**MEDIUM** (address for production quality):
- Code organization
- Event completeness
- Function clarity
- Inheritance simplification

**LOW** (nice to have):
- Additional tests
